# Advanced AI Features Roadmap

## Implemented

- Basic code analysis with Google Generative AI
- AI-powered chat assistant for coding questions
- Structured bug detection and suggestions
- Comprehensive code analysis with ethical, security, and compliance awareness
- Multi-category issue detection and classification
- Visual indicators for different types of code concerns

## Advanced Code Analysis Capabilities

### Security Analysis

- Detection of hardcoded credentials and API keys
- Identification of common security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection flaws)
- Insecure code pattern recognition
- Suggestions for security best practices

### Ethical Analysis

- Detection of potential bias in algorithms and data handling
- Identification of fairness issues in code logic
- Privacy and consent concerns in data collection
- Inappropriate data usage detection

### Compliance Checking

- GDPR compliance considerations
- CCPA data handling requirements
- Industry-specific regulation awareness (HIPAA, financial, etc.)
- Intellectual property concern identification

### Additional Analysis Categories

- Accessibility evaluation for UI components
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Code quality and maintainability assessment
- Environmental impact considerations for inefficient code

## Planned Enhancements

- **Streaming Responses**: Token-by-token AI responses using server-sent events
- **Multi-model Support**: Toggle between different AI models (Gemini Pro, GPT-4, Claude, local Mixtral)
- **Context-aware Learning**: System that remembers previous interactions and code fixes
- **Code Performance Analysis**: AI suggestions for optimizing code performance
- **Security Vulnerability Scanner**: Detect common security issues in code
- **Customizable Analysis Focus**: Let users specify what aspects to focus on (performance, security, style)
