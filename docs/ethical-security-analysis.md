# Ethical and Security Analysis Features

## Overview

Code Companion goes beyond traditional code editors by analyzing code for ethical concerns, security vulnerabilities, and compliance issues that standard linters or editors typically miss. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, we provide comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions of code quality.

## Key Features

### Multi-Category Issue Detection

Code Companion categorizes issues into specialized domains:

| Category          | Description                                              | Examples                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**      | Identifies potential security vulnerabilities            | API key exposure, injection flaws, XSS vulnerabilities   |
| **Ethics**        | Detects potentially biased or ethically problematic code | Gender/racial bias in algorithms, unfair data processing |
| **Privacy**       | Finds privacy concerns in data handling                  | Excessive data collection, insecure data storage         |
| **Compliance**    | Highlights regulatory compliance issues                  | GDPR violations, CCPA non-compliance                     |
| **Accessibility** | Identifies accessibility barriers                        | Screen reader incompatibility, color contrast issues     |
| **Code Quality**  | Traditional code quality concerns                        | Bugs, performance issues, maintainability problems       |
| **Performance**   | Performance optimization opportunities                   | Inefficient algorithms, resource waste                   |

### Security Vulnerability Detection

- **Credential Scanning**: Detects hardcoded API keys, tokens, and secrets
- **Injection Protection**: Identifies SQL, command, and script injection vulnerabilities
- **XSS Prevention**: Detects cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications
- **Insecure Patterns**: Flags use of eval(), innerHTML, and other risky functions
- **Authentication Issues**: Identifies weak authentication implementations

### Ethical Code Analysis

- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential algorithmic bias in decision-making code
- **Fairness Checks**: Analyzes if code treats different groups fairly
- **Privacy Analysis**: Evaluates how user data is collected, stored, and processed
- **Inclusive Design**: Suggests improvements for more inclusive applications
- **Transparency Recommendations**: Advises on making algorithms more transparent

### Compliance Guidance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Checks for proper data handling under European regulations
- **CCPA Alignment**: Identifies California Consumer Privacy Act considerations
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Highlights health data protection requirements
- **Financial Regulations**: Notes financial data handling concerns
- **Cross-Border Data**: Advises on international data transfer implications

### Visualization and Understanding

- **Color-Coded Categories**: Each issue type has distinct visual indicators
- **Severity Classification**: Issues are ranked by impact (error/warning/info)
- **Contextual Explanations**: Each category includes educational information about why it matters
- **Guided Remediation**: Step-by-step suggestions for addressing complex issues

## Implementation Details

### AI-Powered Analysis

Code Companion uses sophisticated prompt engineering to guide AI models in detecting issues across multiple dimensions:

```typescript
const promptText = `
  You are an expert software developer specializing in debugging and code review 
  with a focus on both technical correctness, security, and ethical considerations.
  
  Analyze the following ${language} code for bugs, errors, security vulnerabilities, 
  ethical concerns, or potential improvements...
`;
```

### Static Analysis Enhancement

In addition to AI analysis, we perform direct pattern matching for common issues:

```typescript
const checkForSecrets = (line: string, lineNumber: number, issues: Array<{...}>) => {
  // Check for common secret patterns
  const secretPatterns = [
    { pattern: /api[_-]?key/i, name: 'API Key' },
    { pattern: /auth[_-]?token/i, name: 'Auth Token' },
    // Additional patterns...
  ];

  // Check logic...
};
```

### User Interface Integration

The SuggestionEngine component provides rich visualization of different issue types:

```tsx
<span
  className={`ml-2 text-xs px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full ${getCategoryColor(
    suggestion.category
  )}`}
>
  {suggestion.category}
</span>
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Industry-Specific Analysis**: Specialized analysis for healthcare, finance, etc.
- **Custom Policy Enforcement**: Allow organizations to define custom ethical policies
- **Regulatory Updates**: Keep compliance checks updated with changing regulations
- **Explainable AI**: Better explanations of why certain code raises ethical concerns
- **Mitigation Strategies**: More comprehensive guidance on addressing complex issues
